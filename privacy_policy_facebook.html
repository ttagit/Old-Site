from an application such as <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> for Mac, <span
class=SpellE>Facebook</span> for Android or <span class=SpellE>TFacebooketDeck</span>.
When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer,
manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as
described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in
or supply information from, you authorize <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> to

Account Information: When you create or reconfigure a <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span>
account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username,
password, and email address. In some cases, you may be required to provide your
phone number, for example, to use <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> via SMS or
to help <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> prevent spam, fraud, or abuse. Your
name and username are listed publicly on our Services, including on your
profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search and public
user profiles, do not require registration.</p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Additional
Information: You may provide <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> with profile
information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, your <span
class=SpellE>Facebookbsite</span>, or a picture. You may provide information to
customize your account, such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS
messages. <span class=SpellE>Facebooke</span> may use your contact information
to send you information about <span class=GramE>there</span> Services or to
market to you. You may use your account settings to unsubscribe from
notifications from <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span>. You may also unsubscribe
by following the instructions contained within the notification or the
instructions on <span class=SpellE>Facebooks</span> <span class=SpellE>Facebookbsite</span>.
<span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> may use your contact information to help
others find your <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> account, including through
third-party services and client applications. Your privacy settings control
whether others can find you by your email address or cell phone number. You may
choose to upload your address book so that <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span>
can help you find <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> users you know or help
other <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> users find you. <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span>
may later make suggestions to you and other users on <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span>
based on imported address book contacts. You can delete your imported address
book contacts from <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> at any time. If you email
<span class=SpellE>Facebook</span>, <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> may keep
your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request.
If you connect your <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> account to your account
on another service in order to cross-post <span class=SpellE>betFacebooken</span>
<span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> and that service, the other service may send
us your registration or profile information on that service and other
information that you authorize. This information enables <span class=GramE>cross-posting</span>,
helps <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> improve the Services, and is deleted
from <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> within a few <span class=SpellE>Facebookeks</span>
of your disconnecting from <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> your account on
the other service. Providing the additional information described in this
section is entirely optional.</p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'><span
class=SpellE>TFacebookets</span>, Following, Lists and other Public
Information: <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> Services are primarily designed
to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you
provide <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> is information you are asking us to
make public. This includes not only the messages you <span class=SpellE>TFacebooket</span>
and the metadata provided with <span class=SpellE>TFacebookets</span>, such as
when you <span class=SpellE>TFacebooketed</span>, but also the lists you
create, the people you follow, the <span class=SpellE>TFacebookets</span> you
mark as favorites or <span class=SpellE>RetFacebooket</span>, and many other
bits of information that result from your use of the Services. <span
class=SpellE>Facebook</span> may use this information to customize the content <span
class=SpellE>Facebook</span> shows you, including ads. <span class=SpellE>Facebooks</span>
default is almost always to make the information you provide public for as long
as you do not delete it from <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span>, but <span
class=SpellE>Facebook</span> generally give you settings to make the
information more private if you want. <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span>

range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile
information and public <span class=SpellE>TFacebookets</span> are immediately
delivered via SMS and <span class=SpellE>Facebooks</span> APIs to <span
class=SpellE>Facebooks</span> partners and other third parties, including
search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span>
content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public
health agencies that analyze the information for trends and insights. When you
share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services,
you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Location
Information: You may choose to publish your location in your <span
class=SpellE>TFacebookets</span> and in your <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span>
profile. You may also tell <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> your location
when you set your trend location on Facebook.com or your computer or mobile
device sends <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> location information. <span
class=SpellE>Facebook</span> may also use other data from your device to
determine location, for example, information about wireless networks or cell <span
class=SpellE>toFacebookrs</span> near your mobile device, or your IP address. <span
class=SpellE>Facebook</span> may use and store information about your location
to provide features of our Services, such as <span class=SpellE>TFacebooketing</span>
with your location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example,
with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for
people to follow. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Links:
<span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> may keep track of how you interact with
links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party
services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other
means. <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> does this to help improve our
Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share
aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked
on.</p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Cookies:
Like many <span class=SpellE>Facebookbsites</span>, <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span>
use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional <span class=SpellE>Facebookbsite</span>
usage data and to improve our Services, but <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> <span

you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and <span

or application, or visit a third-party <span class=SpellE>Facebookbsite</span>
that includes a <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> button or widget. <span
class=SpellE>Facebook</span> may also receive Log Data when you click on, view
or interact with a link on our Services to a third-party application, such as
when you choose to install another application through <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span>.
<span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> uses Log Data to provide, understand, and
improve our Services. If not already done earlier, for example, as provided
below for Widget Data, <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> will either delete
Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full
IP address, or email address, after 18 months.</p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Widget
Data: <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> may tailor the Services for you based
on your visits to third-party <span class=SpellE>Facebookbsites</span> that

your browser (“Widget Data”). After a maximum of 10 days, <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span>

which is usually instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a <span
class=SpellE>Facebookek</span>. <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> may use
Widget Data to tailor content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow
on <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> and other content you may be interested
in. Tailored content is stored with only browser cookies or device IDs and is
separated from other Widget Data such as page-visit information. Learn more
about the feature, including how you can suspend it or turn it off, here. For <span
class=SpellE>TFacebookets</span>, Log Data, and other information that <span
class=SpellE>Facebook</span> receive from interactions with <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span>
buttons or widgets, please see the other sections of this Privacy Policy.</p>

debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address
