<p>TTwitterets, Following, Lists and other Public Information: Twitter Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide twitter is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you TTwitteret and the metadata provided with TTwitterets, such as when you TTwittereted, but also the lists you create, the people you follow, the TTwitterets you mark as favorites or RetTwitteret, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. Twitter may use this information to customize the content twitter shows you, including ads. Twitters default is almost always to make the information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from Twitter, but twitter generally give you settings to make the information more private if you want. Twitter Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public TTwitterets are immediately delivered via SMS and twitters APIs to twitters partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate Twitter content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public health agencies that analyze the information for trends and insights.
